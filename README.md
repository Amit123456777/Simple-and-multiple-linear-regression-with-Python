# Simple-and-multiple-linear-regression-with-Python

Linear regression is an approach to model the relationship between a single
dependent variable (target variable) and one (simple regression) or more (multiple
regression) independent variables. The linear regression model assumes a linear
relationship between the input and output variables. If this relationship is present,
we can estimate the coefficients required by the model to make predictions on new
data.  🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻

In this article, you will learn how to visualize and implement the linear regression
algorithm from scratch in Python using multiple libraries such as Pandas, Numpy,
Scikit-Learn, and Scipy. Additionally, we will measure the direction and strength of
the linear relationship between two variables using the Pearson correlation
coefficient as well as the predictive precision of the linear regression model using
evaluation metrics such as the mean square error.  🤖🤖🤖👩‍💻👩‍💻
